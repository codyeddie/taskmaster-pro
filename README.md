# Taskmaster Pro

## Purpose
Taskmaster Pro is an application that lets you create tasks dynamically with a custom name and due date. These tasks are saved to local storage and will highlight either red or yellow when nearing due date or become overdue. When a task is completed or no longer needed, you can delete the task by dragging it into the delete dropzone or delete all tasks by clicking on the delete tasks button.
